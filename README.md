The Android application uses bluetooth to communicate with the strokebeat device and GPS to find weather conditions of user's location. It has three tabs, first listing the risks for the 
strokes, second tab displaying the user's vital signs (heart rate, body temperature, level of sweating) and finally the third tab one can find some suggestions to prevent stroke.
